Networks
========





A network can be made of multiple input layers.

It can only 1 output layer. If it needs the same layers and at the end
different output layers then it is to be written as 1 new 
output layers.
If they dont share all the intermediate/input layers then it as to be a
done s multiple networks with weight sharing.
It it is multiple inputs and multiple outputs then it is multiple networks independent
