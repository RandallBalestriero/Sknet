Quickstart
==========

Data Loading
------------

To load any of the pre-coded dataset, use the following

.. code-block:: python
    from ranet.dataset import mnist

The currently available dataset are 



Running the code test_loading.py will generate the following figure

.. figure:: test_loading.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: map to buried treasure

   This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).


Data Pre-Processing
-------------------

The data can be pre-processed prior performing any task.
We provide the following basic pre-processing steps:

- standardize   : scale and center the data

- PCA whitening : use PCA whitening

- ZCA whitening : use ZCA whitening

Running the code test_preprocessing.py will generate the following figure:



Directive for displayed math (math that takes the whole line for itself).

The directive supports multiple equations, which should be separated by a
blank line::

    .. math::

         (a + b)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\

         (a - b)^2 &= a^2 - 2ab + b^2



Data Augmentation
-----------------

We provide some simple data augmentation tools that can be combined, they are commutative layers:

- random flip

- random crop

- dropout (additive and multiplicative)
